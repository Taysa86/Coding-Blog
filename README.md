# E-Commerce backend

# Description
This is the server for an E-commerce website. I was working on multiple projects at once, and got a little turned around. I failed to make commits to the repository as I worked on it. In fact, I submitted an empty repository for grading because I had been commiting under the wrong file.

# Usage
This is a video on how to use the get feature and illustrating some of the issues i'm having with posting.
